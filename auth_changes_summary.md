# Authentication Flow Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The authentication flow in Pixelodon has been revised to address several issues and improve reliability. The changes were inspired by examining the official Pixelfed and Mastodon client implementations.

### 1. PKCE Implementation Improvements

- Simplified the storage mechanism for PKCE code verifiers
- Replaced the complex JSON-based storage with direct key-value storage
- Added better error handling and validation for code verifier storage and retrieval
- Improved debugging information for PKCE-related operations

### 2. Token Management Enhancements

- Updated token storage format to include additional information:
  - Access token
  - Refresh token
  - Token expiration time
  - Token type
  - Creation timestamp
- Added support for token refresh when tokens expire
- Implemented backward compatibility with the old token storage format
- Improved error handling during token exchange

### 3. OAuth Callback Handling

- Enhanced parameter extraction from both query parameters and URI fragments
- Added explicit error parameter checking
- Improved validation of required parameters (code, state, domain)
- Better error messages for users when authentication fails
- Proper exception propagation to the UI layer

### 4. Logout Process Improvements

- Updated logout to handle both access tokens and refresh tokens
- Improved token revocation with better error handling
- Added support for the new token storage format

### 5. Instance Management

- Added instance information updating when re-authenticating
- Improved error handling during instance discovery

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **More Reliable Authentication**: The improved PKCE implementation and better error handling make the authentication process more reliable.

2. **Better User Experience**: More descriptive error messages and automatic token refresh provide a better user experience.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Proper token revocation and improved PKCE implementation enhance the security of the authentication flow.

4. **Longer Sessions**: Support for refresh tokens allows users to stay logged in for longer periods without re-authentication.

5. **Better Compatibility**: The implementation now better aligns with standard OAuth practices used by Mastodon and Pixelfed instances.

## Next Steps

While the current implementation addresses the immediate issues, future improvements could include:

1. More comprehensive testing of the authentication flow
2. Implementation of multi-account support with better UI
3. Adding support for additional OAuth scopes
4. Implementing a more robust token storage mechanism with encryption
