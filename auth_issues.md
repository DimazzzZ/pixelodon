# Authentication Implementation Issues

Based on code review and comparison with reference implementations, the following issues have been identified in the current authentication flow:

1. **PKCE Implementation Issues**: The current implementation attempts to use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security, but there are issues with how code verifiers are stored and retrieved. The debug logs in the code suggest there might be problems with this functionality.

2. **Error Handling**: The current implementation has limited error handling, especially during the token exchange process. The Pixelfed implementation has more robust error handling with specific alerts for different error scenarios.

3. **Token Storage and Verification**: The current implementation doesn't have a mechanism to verify stored tokens periodically or handle token expiration. The Pixelfed implementation includes credential caching with expiration.

4. **OAuth Flow Completion**: The callback handling in oauth_callback_screen.dart has issues with extracting parameters from different URI formats (query parameters vs. fragments).

5. **Deep Linking Configuration**: There might be issues with how deep linking is configured for the OAuth callback.

6. **Browser Handling**: The current implementation uses url_launcher which might not handle the OAuth flow as smoothly as WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync used in the Pixelfed implementation.

7. **Missing Refresh Token Support**: The current implementation doesn't handle refresh tokens, which are important for maintaining long-term authentication.
